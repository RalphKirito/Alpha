	<p><dfn>These are my honest thoughts and reflections about a not-so random mix of topics that I care about--startups, my home country, social change, impact and YouthHack. It's very easy to feel jaded by the world we live in today.</dfn></p>

	<p>It's very easy to feel jaded by the world we live in today. With social media, it's very easy to be influenced by what we read online and think that we're in a vicious cycle that can't be broken.</p>

	<p>For example, here in the Philippines, with election season on the roll, I see countless of these posts about the problems with Philippine politics and why no president can solve the societal problems we face.</p>

	<p>You question whether or not our world is actually going to get better even with all the excitement about technology, startups and entrepreneurship. Even when entrepreneurs like Mark Zuckerberg tries to democratize access to the internet, they get bashed on. For someone like me who has believed that startups might just be the world's saving grace, I had to think for a moment as articles about 'Tinder for dogs' pops up in my newsfeed.</p>

	<p>But it was during this winter break where I got an opportunity to think about whether or not startups and technology could solve the problems we face here in the Philippines and in the greater world.</p>

	<p>I've spent a lot of time this winter break thinking about how we can truly make an impact in the society we live in today. While I still haven't figured out the exact answer, being back in my home country the Philippines did one good thing for me: it gave me hope--hope for the future.</p>

	<p>It was just last Friday when we held a mini-retreat for the new core team members of YouthHack Manila. There were three moments that gave me this renewed hope.</p>

	<p class="bold">Our team has grown by A LOT.</p>
	<p>One and a half years ago, we had 5 people in our YouthHack core team. Fast-forward to today and we have over 44 members here in Manila with around 30 more members in our other chapters across the world.</p>

	<p>It's crazy to think about how much our family has grown but it's also exciting to think about what we can do now that we have a much bigger team. We want to help every single one of our members to really become ambassadors of youth entrepreneurship education and empowerment. We want them to be the catalysts in their community, the people who will be instigating change. I honestly think we've found the right members to do so.</p>

	<p class="bold">What if everyone in this room started a new YouthHack chapter?</p>
	<p>During the goal reflection we had, one particular line by one of our new core team members struck me, 'what would happen if every person in this room starts a YouthHack initiative in their own area?' In a room that was filled with high school and university students from all over the Philippines, it was hard not to think about the possibilities. Maybe by the end of this year a lot more students from all over the Philippines will be empowered to solve problems in their community through startups, technology and/or entrepreneurship.</p>

	<p class="bold">YouthHack is something that started in the Philippines but is slowly turning into a global movement.</p>
	<p>These past few days, weeks and months have been extremely overwhelming. It was only when I decided to make a welcome video for the new YouthHack Manila members did I realize how much YouthHack has grown not just in the Philippines, but globally.

	<p>What started out as a two-day event here in Manila to help high school students to learn more about startups, technology and entrepreneurship has turned into a global movement. Suddenly I remembered what inspired me to dive into the startup scene in the first-place: the sense of possibility driven by the unique culture of innovation, problem-solving, community and collaboration.</p>

	<p>Just like how it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community to build a movement, to change a broken system.</p>

	<p>I got home from our YouthHack retreat to see three messages in my inbox: one from somebody who wanted to start a YouthHack Congo, one from somebody who wanted to start a YouthHack Korea and one from somebody who wanted to start a YouthHack Liberia.</p>

	--

	<p>Maybe through YouthHack we can show other youth and students from around the world that it's possible to create something that brings people from different races, social statuses, cultures, cities, countries, passions and interests together.</p>

	<p>Maybe I'm getting too ahead of myself. Maybe I'm being a bit too idealistic. Maybe all this will remain an ideal dream. But it's okay because it never hurts to try and give it a shot because if we don't, how can we expect others to do so?</p>
