	<p>YouthHack events are always something I look forward to because every event has its own defining learning experience. With the team retreat last week, "pivot" best describes my learning experience. Pivot is a term used in product development to refer to changing product features after testing the product and receiving feedback. It has recently become a buzzword used to refer to startups and businesses that change their scope or approach in order to survive or adapt to the market. At its most basic level, a pivot is all about change; it's a shift in perspective or position. During the day-long retreat designed to introduce the newly accepted members to YouthHack, I was also reintroduced to the community I had joined less than a year ago. As much as YouthHack has grown in the past year with all the programs implemented in YouthHack Manila, Philadelphia, Hong Kong, and Singapore, along with (YouthHack's head) David Ongchoco's email flooding with interested chapter founders based in Italy, Dubai, Nigeria, and Korea, this burgeoning community is still a toddler feeling the ground before it can resolutely stand on its own two feet. In Tagalog, "nangangapa pa." While this metaphor won't immediately inspire confidence, I believe it's YouthHack's greatest strength.</p>

	<p>Listening to David retell his journey and the executive team share their experiences, I realized just how much YouthHack has gone through. However, once I got to hear the new members share their goals and aspirations, I also realized just how much YouthHack has yet to go through. Some of the applicants I had interviewed would share how amazed and inspired they are by the work David and his team has done, thinking that YouthHack has already been around longer than it actually has. Well, that's the magic of it all. This community wasn't formed overnight, but it sure came together faster than any of us expected, and it's still growing. This is where the pivot comes in. With YouthHack having hustled and hacked this far, the retreat, and even the planning involved for the retreat, gave me a moment to pause and look back at the trail we left behind, as well as the unexplored paths ahead. This was the way I knew YouthHack underwent a pivot.</p>

	<p>Before the retreat, I regarded YouthHack in the same way some of the applicants I interviewed did-- awestruck, amazed, and even intimidated. Planning for the retreat, I realized that this approach won't be the best one in which to move forward. It's like a man getting stopped in his tracks by an attractive woman walking by. Locked in a trance, the man would probably end up literally falling head over heels chasing the woman. I was in a trance as well, and in order to keep up, I had to shake off the charms. What makes this community great isn't so much as what has been accomplished in such a short time, but the potential it has to accomplish even more in the long run. Regarding YouthHack in this way makes me feel more empowered to contribute to helping it stand firmly on its feet. It's something that I wouldn't have realized had I not interviewed applicants or gone through the retreat. This opportunity for the old and new members to share what YouthHack has been and will be for them was a breath of fresh air for everyone. As we ate pizza and took photos for Human of YouthHack, I could feel the air buzzing with energy brought on by the anticipation of implementing our projects for 2016. The environment was not unfamiliar but I was more aware of it than I was before, with my sensitivity heightened because I was unable to grab a slice before they ran out.</p>

	<p>In the days leading up to the retreat, as I underwent the pivot, I told David that I was afraid YouthHack was growing faster than it could hold its ground. How could we ensure that this growing global community could stand on its own in the long run? During the retreat, David showed us a video of some of the YouthHack members from the other chapters introduce themselves and deliver messages for the recruits. That unexpected segment in our retreat was the answer. While the audio wasn't really great for the most part, seeing and listening to these passionate individuals from the different YouthHack chapters talk to us knocked down my fears. With all of us communicating and collaborating, maximizing this global network, YouthHack can keep up with its own growth and exceed all expectations. It won't be easy, but we'll be working together. "Kung mangangapa man tayo, sama-sama na tayong mangangapa."</p>

	<p>Being in the midst of all of this growth in YouthHack can be overwhelming, but I remember a quote by writer Robin Sharma I saw on my feed a few months back. "All change is hard at first, messy in the middle and so gorgeous at the end." Indeed, I look forward to the gorgeous ends, but more so the difficult beginnings, messy middles, and the retreats in between, when I can take a moment to pivot and get a fresh perspective moving forward. In the meantime, Slack (the team's groupchat) calls and much work needs to be done.</p>
