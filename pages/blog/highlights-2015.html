		<p>2015 was a big year for YouthHack. In between the several events, workshops, programs and meetups, it was during this 2015 when YouthHack grew from a small organization back in the Philippines into a global one. Since holding our first-event back in July 2014, YouthHack has gone on to start programs in the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and the US with over 800 students participating. Weâ€™re excited to see how much YouthHack grows in the upcoming year but for now, weâ€™re thankful for all the support we got this 2015 ðŸ™‚ Hereâ€™s a recap of the Top 15 Milestones and Moments from this awesome year!</p>

		<p class="bold">1. YouthHack Philadelphia â€˜Shark Tankâ€™ Challenge 2015</p>

		<p>Last April 26, 2015, we had our very first YouthHack Philadelphia event for high school students. We had around 25 kids come over to hear from experienced entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. This first event was a great way for us to get our foot in the door in the Philly startup scene which led to a lot more opportunities in the following months. In fact, two high school students from this event would end up joining the YouthHack Philadelphia core team.</p>

		<p class="bold">2. YouthHack Manila 2015 Fellowship Program</p>

		<p>One of our goals for 2015 was to create programs that would allow YouthHack participants to continue learning about startups, technology and entrepreneurship even after our events. Inspired by HackNYâ€™s Fellowship program, we decided to startup a YouthHack Fellowship program that connected 20 high school and university students to startups for summer internships this 2015. Our fellows ended up doing some really awesome work that our partner startups started asking for more fellows.</p>

		<p>Check out this Philippine Daily Inquirer article written by one of our YouthHack 2015 Fellows Michiko Lokin on her internship experience <a href="http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/204221/what-i-learned-as-an-intern-at-a-start-up" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p class="bold">3. YouthHack Singapore Startup Challenge</p>

		<p>After high school student Sonia Saravanan reached out to us, we decided to bring YouthHack Singapore. In our one-day startup challenge, we had over 100 university and high school students attend our first-event where they got to hear from top entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and pitch their ideas as well. Winners got a chance to join JFDI Asiaâ€™s Discover program.</p>

		<p class="bold">4. YouthHack Manila Code Weekend 2015</p>

		<p>Thereâ€™s still a very big gap when it comes to STEM education in the Philippines so we wanted to encourage more students to get interested in coding by helping them dive into it through a 36-hour Code Weekend that we held in Microsoft Philippines. Over 80 students participated in this inaugural event and a good amount of them ended up building a functional hack/prototype by the end of the weekend.</p>

		<div class="graphic"><img src="../../images/yh-codeweekend2016-gallery/34.jpg" alt="34.jpg" class="materialboxed"><div class="capt">YouthHack Startup Challenge 2015 Pitching</div></div>
		<p class="bold">5. YouthHack Manila Startup Challenge 2015</p>

		<p>This was by far our biggest event yet. Over 250 students attended this 2-day Startup Challenge we hosted back in July. We had multiple keynote speakers, networking sessions, 7 simultaneous workshops, a startup fair and the annual pitch competition. Phew. Check out this photo of over these future entrepreneurs building new relationships with each other ðŸ™‚.</p>

		<p class="bold">6. YouthHack Manila Startup Fair</p>

		<p>During our biggest Startup Challenge event yet, we decided to put together a Startup Fair on the side as well where we brought over 20 startups to setup and share with the students what they were working on. From 3D Printers to Bamboo Bikes to Sharing Economy apps, the future of the Philippines was right there.</p>

		<p class="bold">7. YouthHack gets featured in Tech in Asia</p>

		<p>As a startup organization that started out in the Philippines, getting featured in Tech In Asia was a milestone that really helped us validate our vision as well to go beyond the Philippines and become a regional and global platform that helps students turn their ideas into realities. You can read the post <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/youthhack-goes-international/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p class="bold">8. YouthHack Hong Kong 2015</p>

		<p>We held our first-ever YouthHack Hong Kong event. Always exciting being in another ecosystem and we learned how Hong Kong is really trying to ramp up its startup scene. Hopefully we can be part of this rise. You can read the post <a href="http://youthhack.net/blog/2015/08/23/youthhack-hong-kong-startup-bootcamp-2015-recap/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p class="bold">9. YouthHack Manila 2015 Finalists Become Finalists at Harvard Social Innovation Competition</p>

		<p>Last year, we had one YouthHack Manila team make it to the finals of the Harvard Social Innovation Competition. This year, we had two finalists from our 2015 Startup Challenge that ended up going to Harvard to present their innovative ideas.</p>

		<p class="bold">10. YouthHack FreshStart Program in Philadelphia</p>

		<p>With a goal of further building the YouthHack Philadelphia community, we did a 21-day freshman program to help Penn and Drexel freshmen dive into the Philadelphia startup scene. We met several times a week as students developed their ideas, heard from local entrepreneurs and VCs and had a final-day pitch session.</p>

		<p class="bold">11. YouthHack Philadelphia High School Coding Workshop</p>

		<p>After partnering with the Internet Education Foundation, we decided to kickstart our high school programs once again and host a coding workshop for Philadelphia high school students. The students ended up learning HTML/CSS/Bootstrap and building their first websites in a full-day workshop.</p>

		<p class="bold">12. YouthHack Manila &amp; Philadelphia recruiting for 2016</p>

		<p>Our YouthHack family is growing. One of the best parts about YouthHack is getting to work with a group of really ambitious and smart individuals. Weâ€™re excited to be growing the YouthHack team in Manila and Philadelphia to continue improving our events and programs. Woohoo!! Excited to welcome the new members of our family!</p>

		<p class="bold">13. YouthHack Philadelphia Startup Tour</p>

		<p>As part of the FreshStart program, we organized a startup tour for the freshmen to really dive into the Philadelphia Startup Scene. We ended up visiting Curalate, DreamIt Ventures, RJ Metrics and Tecnical.ly Philly.</p>

		<div class="graphic"><img src="../../images/blog/yh-soon.jpg" alt="yh-soon.jpg" class="materialboxed"><div class="capt">YouthHack-Nigeria coming soon!</div></div>
		<p class="bold">14. YouthHack starts its expansion plans to Nigeria, Australia, Thailand &amp; Sri Lanka</p>

		<p>This year was a big year for YouthHack and we just finished working on the logistics and expansion plan into a few new countries. Itâ€™s really exciting when you have young people reaching out to bring YouthHack to other countries because they want to help empower students. Weâ€™re really excited for the start of these new chapters next year!</p>

		<p class="bold">15. YouthHack Platform â€¦ Coming Soon ðŸ™‚</p>

		<p>The thing weâ€™re most excited about at YouthHack is that weâ€™re working on a platform that will allow us to really empower students to turn their ideas into realities. Weâ€™re hoping to help students showcase their startup projects and continue getting feedback from mentors even after our programs and events. Weâ€™re currently in the development phase, and we canâ€™t wait to continue helping students from all over the world.</p>

		<p>And thatâ€™s a wrap. 15 milestones and moments from 2015. None of which would have been possible without the help of all our team members, sponsors, partners, mentors and of course our community. Thank you ðŸ™‚</p>
