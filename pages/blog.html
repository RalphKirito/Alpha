			"CAN WE really make it?" I thought to myself when teammates from Maroon Hackers started toying with the idea of bringing YouthHack to Region IV-A (Calabarzon). Since its founding in 2014, YouthHack has continued to help students learn about start-ups, technology and entrepreneurship. It has branched out to different countries including Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, Italy and Nigeria. Once your goal is clear, the rest will follow. My main concern was that most of the technopreneurial institutions and companies are based in Metro Manila, which could hinder the growth of the chapter. Suddenly, I realized that this was not only a problem of logistics and expansion. It actually answered the question, "Why do we exist?"

			YouthHack events are always something I look forward to because every event has its own defining learning experience. With the team retreat last week, "pivot" best describes my learning experience. Pivot is a term used in product development to refer to changing product features after testing the product and receiving feedback. It has recently become a buzzword used to refer to startups and businesses that change their scope or approach in order to survive or adapt to the market. At its most basic level, a pivot is all about change; it's a shift in perspective or position. During the day-long retreat designed to introduce the newly accepted members to YouthHack, I was also reintroduced to the community I had joined less than a year ago. As much as YouthHack has grown in the past year with all the programs implemented in YouthHack Manila, Philadelphia, Hong Kong, and Singapore, along with (YouthHack's head) David Ongchoco's email flooding with interested chapter founders based in Italy, Dubai, Nigeria, and Korea, this burgeoning community is still a toddler feeling the ground before it can resolutely stand on its own two feet. In Tagalog, "nangangapa pa." While this metaphor won't immediately inspire confidence, I believe it's YouthHack's greatest strength.

			These are my honest thoughts and reflections about a not-so random mix of topics that I care about--startups, my home country, social change, impact and YouthHack. It's very easy to feel jaded by the world we live in today. With social media, it's very easy to be influenced by what we read online and think that we're in a vicious cycle that can't be broken. For example, here in the Philippines, with election season on the roll, I see countless of these posts about the problems with Philippine politics and why no president can solve the societal problems we face.

			2015 was a big year for YouthHack. In between the several events, workshops, programs and meetups, it was during this 2015 when YouthHack grew from a small organization back in the Philippines into a global one. Since holding our first-event back in July 2014, YouthHack has gone on to start programs in the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and the US with over 800 students participating. Weâ€™re excited to see how much YouthHack grows in the upcoming year but for now, weâ€™re thankful for all the support we got this 2015 ðŸ™‚ Hereâ€™s a recap of the Top 15 Milestones and Moments from this awesome year!
